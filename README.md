# Project_Two -- Development Branch

### Notes: 

`Main Idea: Creating a chatbot that will generate an investment portfolio based on the user's risk tolerance (measured by age)` 

[apply 110 rule on users age to determining portfolio allocation between stocks, bonds, and crypto]

### Data Collection: 

* How much data do we need to collect? 

    * 10 years of historical price data should be optimal since we need to train a ML model
  
    * Need to determine which stocks, bonds, and crypto we will include when generating portfolio 

    * Suggestions: 

        * pick stocks/bonds/crypto based off of marketcap, popularity, or avg returns

        *  Yahoo Finance API on RapidAPI 


### ML Models: 

* Need to use a model that can group assets based off of certain features 

Chatbot: 
* Need to figure out how to incorporate ML model into chatbot
